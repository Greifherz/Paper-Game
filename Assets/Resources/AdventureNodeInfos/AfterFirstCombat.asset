  MainText: 'The man falls on the ground unconscious. You can''t help but wonder
    what befallen him.


    As a crowd start to gather, you decide to leave before
    any more trouble reaches you. The village you are in doesn''t seem big, only
    dirt roads.


    You are met by what seems to be the largest road on the town,
    possibly crossing it through. You could follow it towards what seems to be the
    center of the village or the other way, to the outskirts.'
