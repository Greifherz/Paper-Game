  MainText: "You were born in a starless night. People like you are not entitled
    to special birth conditions. The sky was cloudy and it was chilly, or so your
    parents used to tell you. \n\nNever you thought it should be special. An ordinary
    person shouldn't even celebrate a new year's cycle, flowers and animals don't,
    why should you?\n\nBut this day you woke to something different. You don't remember
    anymore. Blank mind. The place you wake in feels familiar but you don't know
    why, how. As your mind fill with questions you go out and wander. \n\n<b>Any
    answer to any question.</b>"
